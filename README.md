# MOV - Missed opportunities for vaccination in Peru 2010-2020: A study of socioeconomic inequalities

## Study description
This is the first study published in Peru that uses 11-year DHS to describe the frequency and evolution of MOVs for five vaccines against the leading causes of mortality in children under 5 years old. Moreover, we estimate inequalities in MOV based on socioeconomic variables (Maternal education and Wealth index) at the national and departmental levels. We found that by 2010, the national levels of MOVs reached levels ranging from 45% (pentavalent vaccine) to 78% (rotavirus vaccine). At the national level, we found a greater concentration of inequities in MOVs in the higher socioeconomic strata. However, we identified that the departments with higher poverty rates concentrated higher levels of inequality on MOVs in the lowest strata of the socioeconomic variables. In addition, we found that some departments with similar geographic and socioeconomic characteristics had spatially correlated levels of inequalities on MOVs.
